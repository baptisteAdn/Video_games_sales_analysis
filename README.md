# Video_games_sales_analysis
### Analysis of a Kaggle dataset listing video games sales between 1986 and 2016 - First data analysis

Metacritic, is a website that collect reviews of movies, songs and video games. By scrapping this website the creator of this dataset was able to get interesting data on the video games industry between 1986 and 2016. This dataset can be divided in three categories of data :
    -1) The information on the game: Name, Year of release, Publisher or even Genre;
    -2) The number of million units sold (per region): North America, Europe, Japan, Other and Global;
    -3) Finally, the critics: divided between user critics and a critic score determined by averaging the critics of a number of different profesional critics.
    
For the purpose of this analysis, the critic aspect will be ignore to focus more on the sales. The following question will be answered: What are the most successful games ? Which region is leading the global sales trend ? What is the most successful editor ? And finally for which platform sold more games ?

This is a first try at doing an analysis of this type using Jupyter Notebook and Python. A particular focus will be adress to the following learning points:
    - Data manipulation with pandas;
    - Data visualization with seaborn and matplotlib;
